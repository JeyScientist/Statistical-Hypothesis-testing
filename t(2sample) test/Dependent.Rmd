null hypothesis: population means are qual.
alternative hypothesis: ppn is unequal
           alpha=.05
```{r}
df <- read.csv("Advertise.csv")
summary(df)
```


```{r}
shapiro.test(df$Radio)
```
 dataset is not normally distributed



```{r}
shapiro.test(df$Newspaper)
```
 dataset is not normally distributed
```{r}
var.test(df$Newspaper, df$Radio)
```

```{r}
t.test(df$Newspaper, df$Radio,
       alternative = "two.sided",
       paired=TRUE)
```
We accept the H1: that ppn means are unequal.
t=3.5747 means that newspaper results are higher than that of radio.

```{r}
cor(df$Newspaper, df$Radio)
```
